# Caveat Emptor - This works as of December 2024
- The worst part is setting up the app password in the account at GMail.  They are making it harder and harder to find
- Go to the email account and click on the gear icon for options
- Set up two factor authentication
- Scroll down to the bottom and set up an app password
- This is only generated once so copy it down!
- It may have spaces in it but this does not affect substituting it in Postfix for a password
